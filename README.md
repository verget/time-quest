# Time Quest

Serverless Ionic application made with Firebase and Type Script.

## Disclaimer

I spent few years with night city quests like [Encounter](http://en.cx/), and found many friends here, so this simple landing 
page and Ionic application was build in a few evenings for one of my game-firends like mobile platform for game organization.

## For what?

Main idea is: you have coundown application on your device, and you in game until time is over. In first you have 40 minutes, but can looking for a keys and increase it.

## What is here?

* Landing page with game rules for new gamers
* Realtime updates without page refresh
* 2 interfaces for admins and regular players
* Push notifications by Google Firebase
* Serverless backend logic and database on Firebase
* Good looking on any screens.
